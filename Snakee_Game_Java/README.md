## Project Information 
Project Title: Snake Game Coursework (COMP2013) 
Project Folder Name: snakee_2022 
Author Name: Carolina Louro 

## Brief Project Description
This project will maintain and extend a re-implementation of the classic retro game called Snake.
The game will have three modes (easy, medium and advanced), where players are responsible for choosing their levels. 
The game will also differ from one mode to another making it more fun for the player to have to go through different level/obstacles. 
The players will be able to see the score board from other player's too, showing the highest score so they can try to beat it. 
Essentially, the project will implement the Snake game as well as adding more features to it. 
New feature I included: bomb obstacles as well as stars (bonus points), music for different levels, pop-up windows wiht warnings, lives.
Obstacles (easy): normal game play 
Obstacles (medium): one obstacle which if snake touches will loose a life and after three lives snake dies 
Obstacles (hard): multiple objects and bonus points 

## How to install and run the project
To install the project download the zip file and unzip it. 
Then open the project using IntelliJ idea. 
Download any libraries requested (JLayer libary in Maven).  
Run the game by running the StartScreenView javafx class, which will direct you to the main game page. 

## How to use the project (how to play the game)
To play the game, start by running the JavaFX class. 
A window will pop up which will provide guidance on how to proceed. 
This JavaFX start screen will contain: 
1. choice of background and snake colour 
2. a text box where the player should enter their name 
3. an option for level preferred (easy, medium, hard)
4. three modes (easy, medium or advanced) 
As soon as the player presses one of the modes it will direct them to the game. 
Then the player will need to use their own keyboard input to move the snake. 
Game goes on until snake hits a wall or touches an obstacle three times. 
Then a pop-up window will appear showing you the score and the highscore.
